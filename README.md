## Run the script
* Install dependencies: ```pip install -r requirement.txt``` in your cmd.

* Or you can MANUALLY install the Libraries and Modules Used.


* Run : ```python main.py``` 



## Additional Note:
* The following files are independent searching algorithms for respective e-commerce websites which can be used:
  [amazon_searcher.py](https://github.com/shreemantolahiri/E-Commerce-Price-Comparison-Engine/blob/main/amazon_searcher.py)
  
  [flipkart_searcher.py](https://github.com/shreemantolahiri/E-Commerce-Price-Comparison-Engine/blob/main/flipkart_searcher.py)
* The following file is the raw main file without the Tkinter-GUI, which runs only on python terminal:

  [without_gui.py](https://github.com/shreemantolahiri/E-Commerce-Price-Comparison-Engine/blob/main/without_gui.py)

Hope you liked our tool.
